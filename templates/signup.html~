							<div class="content">
								<ul>
									<li><p>Experience with programming or working in the computer science industry</p></li>
									<li><p>A desire to work with youth</p></li>
									<li><p>A fun and encouraging attitude</p></li>
								</ul>
								<p>You do not need to be a technical guru to be a mentor or offer to help. Genuine interest and encouragement goes a long way!</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="expander">
							<h4 class="title">Is there a minimum age?</h4>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Nope! Mentors can be parents, professionals, university students, high school students, or young dojo ninjas. If you know your stuff, you can be a mentor!</p>
								<p>Each dojo will determine what level of help they need, for a session, and assign mentors accordingly</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="expander">
							<h4 class="title">How often do you need mentors?</h4>
							<div class="content">
								<p>We need mentors at every session. How often you volunteer is up to you - help one time or as often as you like.</p>
								<p>You choose which sessions and what topics match your background, and show up when you can.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="expander">
							<h4 class="title">How many mentors do you need at a session?</h4>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Between 6-8 mentors at every session would be ideal.</p>
								<p>The number of mentors directly impacts how many kids can attend, and if we can hold a session.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="expander">
							<h4 class="title">I have a child attending. Can I also be a mentor?</h4>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Yes! Many parents who have a software background, often help as mentors.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="expander">
							<h4 class="title">How do you communicate with mentors?</h4>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Some dojos use GitHub to store, access and comment on projects.</p>
								<p>Once you become an "official" mentor for a session, you will be able to view materials before sessions and submit comments or questions to other mentors.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						
						<div class="expander">
							<h4 class="title">Can I get community service credit?</h4>
							<div class="content">
								<p>Yes! Some companies and schools assign credit for volunteer work in your community.</p>
								<p>If you volunteer as a mentor in Moutain View or San Jose, you can bring your forms and we can sign them!</p>
							</div>

							<p>Knowledge and experience in a specific programming language, robotics or electronics.</p>

					<div class="expander">
						<h4 class="title">Is there a minimum age?</h4>

						<h4 class="title">How often do you need presenters?</h4>

						<h4 class="title">What do you need from a presenter?</h4>
						<div class="content">
						
							<p>Lead presenters typically prepare a project-based lesson on one programming language or environment.  Lessons with a high degree of interactivity, graphics and/or customization possibilities work well with youth participants. Here's what we typically want:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p>Create materials for a 1-2 hour presentation that also allows time for participants to explore and play with the code.</p></li> 

								<li><p>Post project and class materials in advance for the dojo you will be helping.</p></li>

								<li><p>Allow some time before the session for other mentors to review the material and come up to speed.</p></li>

								<li><p>Recommend a challenge problem or review materials the participants can work on independently after the session.</p></li>

					<div class="expander">
						<h4 class="title">How do you communicate with presenters?</h4>
						<div class="content">
